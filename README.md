## Types of Exercises

### Playground

Playground exercises are short coding exercises, which are topic specific, that needs to be written in the browser itself. It will have a code with TODOs mentioned where the code needs to written by us for solving the exercise. All codes written by me for such Playground exercises are available [here](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Kotlin-for-Java-Devs_Solutions/tree/master/Playground) which is categorized under **packages of the respective topic names**.

### Assignments

Assignments are coding tasks, like the tasks in any online coding competitions, that needs to be completed and submitted through the EduTools plugin of IntelliJ IDE. These are auto-categorized based on the "**Week #**" as assigned by the course itself. All codes written by me for such Assignments are available [here](https://github.com/kaushiknsanji/Kotlin-for-Java-Devs_Solutions/tree/master/Assignments).

## Purpose of Sharing 

This course kind of lives upto any online coding competitions, whilst teaching all the necessary topics in detail. As with any coding competitions, once you complete them all by yourself, you would certainly love to showcase it, and this is what I have done here.
